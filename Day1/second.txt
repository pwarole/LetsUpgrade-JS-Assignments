Q2. Explain difference between var let and const >

A.]var  - 
1. It is a Keyword used to declare variable
2. It gives variable to allows global scope

Example

var a = 12; //Global scope
var b = 24;

var z = a+b;
console.log(z);

B.]let -
1.This keyword is used to declare variable inside curly braces.
2.This variable is local scope
3.We can give same name to variable in let that it only have its scope inside local block 

Example - 
{
  let a = 25;  //local scope
  console.log(a);
}


C.]const - 
1.This keyword is used to declare variable which is const type.
2.It cannot be changed
3.Assign values during declaration only.
//

const fruits = ["apple","mango"]
console.log(fruits);
fruits.push("banana");// It wil get add in fruits array No error
console.log(fruits);

but if we try to add fruits through array
fruits = [ "banana","pineapple","watermelon"];
This will Give Error
